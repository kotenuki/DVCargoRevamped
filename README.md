# DvCargoMod

Allows more cargos to be loaded into more different cars.

Currently, it allows:

- All tanker car loads in all other tankers except the one for milk ;)
- Containerized fluids and gases (e.g. CryoOxygen, Argon) in tankers
- Certain flatcar loads (e.g. Boards, SteelRolls) in box cars
- Certain box car loads on flatcars with or without stakes
- all containers also on flatcars with stakes
